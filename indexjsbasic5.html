1.Left Shift Assignment (<<=) 
It moves the specified amount of bits to the left
and assigns the result to the variable. Y <<= A is equivalent to Y=Y << A


2.Right Shift Assignment (>>=) 
It moves the specified amount of bits to the
right and assigns the result to the variable. Y >>= A is equivalent to Y = Y >>
A 

3.Strict equality (===) 
Compares the equality of two operands with type. If
both value and type are equal then the condition is true otherwise false. Y = 5
and X = ‘5’ Y = = = X is false. 

4.Bitwise Left Shift (<<) 
In this two operators
are used where the first operand is the number and the second operand is the
number of bits to shift to the left. A = 6, B=1 A<<b ="12" 
Bitwise Right Shift (>>) 
In this two operators are used where the first operand is the number and
  the second operand is the number of bits to shift to the right. A = 6, B=1
  A>>B = 3 
Zero Fill Right Shift (>>>) 
It is same as a bitwise right shift the
  only difference is that overflowing bits are discarded. A = 6, B=1 A>>>B = 3
  
  
  5. Optional Chaining (?.) Safely accesses properties, methods, or array
  elements of deeply nested objects. If any part of the chain is null or
  undefined, it returns undefined instead Syntax: let result =
  object?.property</b
